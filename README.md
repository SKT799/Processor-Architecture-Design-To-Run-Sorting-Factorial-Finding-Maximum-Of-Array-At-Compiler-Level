# Overview
In this project we haave designed MIPS 32 Bit processor and simulated at low level how Sorting Algorithm, Factorial Finding, Maximum Of An Array is executed at low level checking the corner cases after extensively analyzing them. This project implements a fully functional MIPS 32-bit processor with advanced data dependency detection and correction logic. The processor features a complete 5-stage pipeline with sophisticated hazard detection and resolution mechanisms, making it capable of executing MIPS assembly programs efficiently while maintaining correctness in the presence of data dependencies.

# Key Highlights
