## Overview
In this project I have designed **MIPS 32-bit processor architecture** and simulated at low level how Sorting Algorithm, Factorial Finding, Maximum Of An Array is executed at low level checking the corner cases after extensively analyzing them. Designed via Verilog Programming each and every detail. This project implements a fully functional MIPS 32-bit processor with advanced data dependency detection and correction logic. The processor features a complete 5-stage pipeline with sophisticated hazard detection and resolution mechanisms, making it capable of executing MIPS assembly programs efficiently while maintaining correctness in the presence of data dependencies.

### Key Highlights
- **Complete MIPS 32-bit ISA implementation**
- **Not only can run sorting algorithm kind of complex programs but also can run by microprogramming using problem solving skills**
- **5-stage pipeline with hazard detection**
- **Data forwarding and stalling mechanisms**
- **Branch prediction and resolution**
- **Comprehensive instruction set support**
- **Modular and extensible design**
- **Extensive testing suite**
